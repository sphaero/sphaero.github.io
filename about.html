<p>Exploring creativity and computing through empowering artists and 
inspriring developers!</p>
<p>According to some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435123003653">energy hungry lurker</a> on internet: </p>
<p><em>"Arnaud Loonstra is a multidisciplinary professional with a background 
in creative coding, open-source software, and media technology. He has 
been involved in various roles, from researcher to developer and 
lecturer, with a strong focus on innovative technology and new media 
art. Loonstra has contributed significantly to projects related to 
interaction design, network security, and the orchestration of 
computer systems, particularly in live performances and Internet of 
Things (IoT) environments. He has also worked on sustainable technology 
solutions for self-sufficient buildings.</em></p>
<p><em>Loonstra holds multiple degrees, including a Master of Science in 
Media Technology from Leiden University and a Bachelor of Arts in 
Virtual Theatre and Games from the HKU University of the Arts. 
His professional journey includes roles such as Creative Coder 
at VPRO, IT Architect, and lecturer at various educational 
institutions, showcasing his versatile expertise in both the technical 
and artistic domains."</em></p>
<p>I am currently involved in the research group <a href="https://www.hku.nl/en/research-and-innovation/research/research-areas/technology">Creative Making Processes
and Technology</a>
of the HKU University of the Arts and experimental time travels to fight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth's_law">Wirth's law</a> while embracing 
<a href="https://permacomputing.net/">permacomputing</a>.</p>
<p><img src="turris.png" width=100 style="float:right"/>
This website <a href="https://github.com/sphaero/appie2/">is built</a> with the principles of 
permacomputing and therefore utilizes no javascript and minimal cascading style 
sheet. It's hosted on a simple 'built to last' home router of an ISP. No cloud service involved
apart from the DNS registrar.</p>
<p>I hardly do any social media so best contact platform is good old email.</p>
