	<h1>Bartje</h1>

	<p>Actions and action stories mostly point at a main character or a group of main characters. The big problem they always bump into can only be solved by way of smaller problems that find their definition of the problem and its solution in a certain action. These actions can be pointed at the environment or other characters, or a combination of these.</p>

	<p>For this project we created a visual story with a superhero as a main character. Our Superhero is a guy living in a village with his grandfather. He loves to knit but is always bullied for that reason. When his grandfather dies he decides to leave the village. During his journey he meets all kinds of small problems which he solves with his knitting power. He ends up living with a beer family. During winter the bears are having their wintersleep so he decides to go back to the village where he came from. Back in the village a major disaster is happening so our superhero is there to save the day.</p>

	<p>All our scenes are made from clay and digitally enhanced. </p>
