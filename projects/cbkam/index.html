	<h1><span class="caps">OPENING</span> : <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SHOW</span></h1>

	<p>To celebrate the opening of their new and freshly renovated location the &#8220;Centrum Beeldende Kunst Utrecht&#8221; (<span class="caps">CBKU</span>) hosted &#8220;<span class="caps">OPENING</span> : <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SHOW</span>&#8221;,  a cross-media project by artist <a href="http://www.mauricebogaert.nl">Maurice Bogaert</a></p>

	<p>Z25 curated one of the show&#8217;s expositions for which I was selected as one of the 7 artists to create an experimantal setup to exhibit. The expo was open for 4 weeks, starting on januari 28, 2010. It ran at different locations in Utrecht, was broadcasted live on the internet and shown as a whole at the <span class="caps">CBKU</span>.</p>

	<p>Using projection mapping we projected a new scenery in a maquette of the new <span class="caps">CBKU</span> building. The maquette was filmed using security cameras which were shown in an installation at the exhibition. This gave the impression what was shown through the security cameras was actually inside the building.</p>

	<p>I created a sequence of inspired by diminishing boundaries when one enters the mind. My contribution <a href="https://youtu.be/eLIabI8eOz4?t=537">starts at 8:50</a>.</p>

	<h2>Artists</h2>

	<h2>Projection mapping</h2>

	<p>Projection mapping is a technique where a projection is &#8216;mapped&#8217; on a physical object. In most cases the perspective is also corrected so when you look at the space all seems to be at the right place. Now virtual objects and shadows can be added or substracted from the physical space, all perspectively correct for the human eye.</p>

	<p>Z25 made this technique available to the artists by organising two workshops in which they could experiment and apply this. After these workshops the artists created their performance and exhibited their work at <span class="caps">OPENING</span> : <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SHOW</span>_</p>

	<h2>Technique</h2>

	<p>I also created all techniques together with z25 for <span class="caps">OPENING</span> : <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SHOW</span>. 6 Maquettes were being filmed at different locations and streamed live over the internet. Z25 built this streaming system based on FFmpeg:http://www.ffmpeg.org. The whole system, existing of dedicated camera systems, a central streaming server and webclients, is completely based on opensource software.</p>
