	<h1>Out</h1>

	<p>Stories steered by problems must be clear in construction of the question at hand. This to make the used imagery and language recognizable to the user. This is to make it understandable to everyone whether it is the intention to reach the other side or to proceed to the center and that there are deliberately placed dead ends.</p>

	<p>Eventually the user will know that the correct way to go is usually not the most logical way to go. This way of thinking play&#8217;s an essential role in stories that deal with problems. More important then the problem itself is the way that the imagery of the problem is communicated to the user. A labyrinth gives an understandable image within this assignment.</p>

	<p>For this project we were assinged to create a story based on &#8216;Labyrinths&#8217;. We created a story about a boy in a imaginary world in which he communicates with his mother. His mother doesn&#8217;t seem to hear him. We has to find it&#8217;s way out by finding out what has happened to him. For this project we we&#8217;re helped out by actors who did all the voice-overs.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine how we made these animations with crappy computers back in the previous century. I remember that we rendered everything at 400&#215;300 pixels because otherwise we would have never have finished the project. I kind of lost the video unfortunately.</p>
