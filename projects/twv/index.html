	<h1>&#8216;t Water Voorbij</h1>

	<p>This videoclip was created during Art Academy. I was asked to do a full autonomous project. Therefore, I started studying the history of the &#8216;smartlap&#8217;, a typical local music genre. My goal was to write my own &#8216;smartlap&#8217;. Although the final product isn&#8217;t a typical &#8216;smartlap&#8217;, it does follow the conventions of the smartlap. Through my study of the history of the &#8216;smartlap&#8217; I found that the &#8216;smartlap&#8217; has a broader range than we would think at first. Because time was on my side I also decided to create a video for the soundtrack.</p>

	<p>The song is about a young man who sings about his despair after his girlfriend decided to end her struggle. The song is entirely in Dutch.</p>

	<p>The music was written by Maarten van der Bijl and myself. Very special thanks to Matthew Groen for his assistance in directing the project.</p>
