<p>Programming for multiple processors is a challenging task. Approaches to program concurrently require a thorough understanding of the computer. Not all people who program possess this. However, as processors are not getting faster, everybody will need to program concurrently eventually. Creative Coding is the practice of programming for being expressive. In this research we propose an easy framework for Creative Coders to program concurrently based on a paradigm of interacting entities. The proposed framework is tested on a group of Creative Coders. The research confirms that concurrent programming is very challenging, that concurrent programs require a different design and that users find it easier to program using the proposed framework.</p>
