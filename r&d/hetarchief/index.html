<p>"Het Archief" was a research project with the aim of embedding an historic stereophotography in a theatre play. The project was setup by Carla Mulder of "<a href="http://lange-poten.nl">Stichting Langepoten</a>" who had inherited this archive of photos.</p>
<p><img alt="Example stereophotography glass" src="_rd_/hetarchief/stereo.gif" /></p>
<p>The research was twofolded. First we had to embrace all the technology required to project stereoscopic images as well converting the historic pictures to these modern technologies. This was accomplished and made available in the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/#_rd_?netsync">Virtools Network Sync Manager</a></li>
<li><a href="#_rd_?stereofrustum_bb">Virtools StereoFrustum Building Block</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly we needed to prepare actors to be aware of playing inside an invisible three dimensional realm. This was done through many rehearsals.</p>
<p>The technology as well as all the virtual assets were made by Ronald Hof, David Zaagsma and myself. Passive stereoscopic projectors were provided by <a href="http://www.prosystems.nl">ProSystems</a></p>
<p>The performance was played on the following occasions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proeflokaal, Rotterdamse Schouwburg, 04-02-2004</li>
<li>Het Archief, Studio Dok, Amsterdam, 01-02-2004</li>
</ul>
