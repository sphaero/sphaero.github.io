<h1 id="how-to">How-to</h1>
<p><em>A how-to is an informal, often short, description of how to accomplish a specific task. A how-to is usually meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic.</em> (source: Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Over the years I have written quite a few of these 'How-tos'. I keep a list here of some of the published documents. They usually target technical topics.</p>
<h2 id="egroupware-server-with-an-ldap-backend">Egroupware Server with an LDAP backend</h2>

<h2 id="w2k-samba-deploy-howto">W2K Samba deploy HOWTO</h2>
<p>A 'HOWTO' about deploying Windows 2000 in a Samba controlled network. This document mostly focus on setting up and rolling out Windows 2000.</p>
<p>While using Samba as main servers in mostly Windows networks I always found it hard to find information about doing certain things in Windows. I'm no MCSE-er and do not ambition to be one ever. It's clear that the information in this document is very accessible for a MCSE-er but for others I found it hard to get all information together and more important FREE. This document came together after many implementations of Samba servers and looking up Usenet archives and other resourceful websites. It has been referenced on the main Samba website. However by now the information is quite outdated.</p>
<p>The document is written in English:</p>
