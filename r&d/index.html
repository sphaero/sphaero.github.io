            <h1>Concurrency for Creative Coding
</h1>

        <p>
            
                Programming for multiple processors is a challenging task. Approaches to program concurrently require a thorough understanding of the computer. Not all people who program possess this. However, as processors are not getting faster, everybody will need to program concurrently eventually. Creative Coding is the practice of programming for being expressive. In this research we propose an easy framework for Creative Coders to program concurrently based on a paradigm of interacting entities. The proposed framework is tested on a group of Creative Coders. The research confirms that concurrent programming is very challenging, that concurrent programs require a different design and that users find it easier to program using the proposed framework.

                In this paper we argue for a unification of coordinate spaces for use in mixed reality setups. The paper introduces most used coordinate systems and proposes a system for unification based on existing coordinate systems. An example is given at the end of the paper.

        <p>
            
                Every new technology needs a tryout in practice. Apart from user tests it is often difficult to prepare a new and immature technology for real use cases. To pave the way for a new technology to practical use we have experimented with artists and developers playing with the technology in a controlled lab sessions (Freaklabs). Although this proves difficult to organize the results are invaluable to steer further development of the technology. In this whitepaper we evaluate three Freaklab sessions for the ZOCP technology.

        <p>
            
                In this document, we explore videostreaming technologies using the Gstreamer framework. Since videostreaming is becoming a commodity it is available for anybody to utilize. However videostreaming technology can be challenging as it can be highly complex. In this document we will introduce the elements needed for videostreaming on a network. We will focus our efforts onto setting up live videostreaming between two hosts.

        </a>
        <p>
            
                Trying to control multiple computers in live performances is a challenging task. Often computers intercommunicate using fixed or manual parameters. However when projects expand across many devices this is hard to maintain. Especially in situations where the parameters tend to change. We propose a new protocol which facilitates flexibility and autonomous setups in an orchestrated environment.

                Multithreading is a potential programmers nightmare. Key in preventing problems while programming multithreaded programs is understanding the source of where problems could arise. In this article the behavior of multithreaded programs is suggested using a metaphor based on the strategy game Dune 2 from the 90's.
