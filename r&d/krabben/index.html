<p>"SDRD" was a research project prior to the installation of a lectorate in the Utrecht University for the Arts. In this project research was done into embracing technologies in theatre around a 
theme of "The Making of Virtual Theatre".  I supported Evert Hoogendoorn in this research.</p>
<p>This research was especially interesting because we applied a technique we now refer to as "Projection Mapping" before it was known. We didn't know of its potential as we just wanted to create a 
continuing perspective using video projection.</p>
<p>In the pictures you can see actors in front of a projection. The caustic lights on the floor continue in the projection. The actors interact with virtual crabs. In this research we were interested
in the dynamics of acting between the virtual and physical.</p>
